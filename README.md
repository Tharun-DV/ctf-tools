This is a tool designed to streamline the reconnaissance process for HackTheBox challenges. Performing comprehensive nmap scans, subdomain enumeration, directory/file discovery, and vulnerability analysis can be a time-consuming and repetitive task. The HackTheBox Recon Accelerator aims to automate these steps, allowing you to focus on the analysis and exploitation phases.

Instead of that hassle, a tool to automate these things would be helpful, so our job is to analyze the results.

## Features to Implement

- [ ] Automate Nmap scan
